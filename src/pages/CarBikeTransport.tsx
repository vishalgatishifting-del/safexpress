                        <h2>Factors Affecting the Cost of Vehicle Transport in India</h2>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Distance -
                                The farther the move, the higher the cost. Longer distances require more fuel, time, and resources, whether you’re shifting a home, office, or other goods.

                            </li>
                            <li>Number of Items -
                                If you have more or heavier items to move, you’ll need a bigger vehicle and more labor, which increases the cost.


                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Packing Quality -
                                Using good packing materials like bubble wrap and boxes keeps your items safe but adds a little extra to the cost, especially for fragile items.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Type of Vehicle -
                                The type of truck or container used depends on how many goods you have. Bigger or special vehicles cost more than small ones.


                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Time of Moving -
                                Moving on weekends, month-end, or during busy seasons usually costs more. Choosing a weekday or off-season date can help you save money.
