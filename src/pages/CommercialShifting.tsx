                        <h2>Factors Affecting the Cost of Commercial Shifting in India</h2>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Distance -
                                Longer distances increase fuel, labor, and time requirements.

                            </li>
                            <li>Quantity & Weight of Goods -
                                More items or heavy machinery require larger vehicles and more manpower.


                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Type of Goods -
                                Fragile or high-value items need special packing and careful handling, adding to cost.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Vehicle Type -
                                Depending on load capacity, open trucks or closed containers are used — larger ones cost more.


                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Timing & Season -
                                Shifting during weekends, month-ends, or peak seasons may cost more than off-peak days.

                            </li>
                        </ol>
